Basic State-Machine For Haxe/OpenFL Games


This State-Machine was adapted for the Haxe programming language
by following a tutorial from Dan Schuller ("How to build a JRPG"),
which you can find under this link:

http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-build-a-jrpg-a-primer-for-game-developers--gamedev-6676


It's a basic State-Machine for Haxe/OpenFL, that is easy to adapt to your framework
of choice. You can use it as a starting point for any game.


Have Fun!
